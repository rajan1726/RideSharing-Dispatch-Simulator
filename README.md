🚖 Ride-Sharing Simulator (Python)

📌 Concept

This project simulates a ride-sharing system where:

Riders are managed in a queue (FIFO). Drivers are assigned using a priority queue (heapq): Nearest driver gets priority. If two drivers are at the same distance, the higher-rated driver is chosen. Each completed ride is recorded in a ride history.

✨ Features

📥 Rider queue using deque 🚗 Driver priority queue using heapq 🎯 Matching algorithm → Nearest + Best driver first 📝 Ride history tracking
